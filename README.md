# Simple Image Slideshow

A fully responsive image slideshow built using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required).

## Features

- Navigation with radio buttons styled as bars for easy switching between slides
- Fully static: no JavaScript required, works only with HTML and CSS
- Responsive design
- Each slide displays an image with an alt description

## How it works

- Uses radio buttons to control which slide is shown
- CSS is used to hide/show slides based on the selected radio button
- Navigation bars below the slideshow allow the user to jump to any slide
